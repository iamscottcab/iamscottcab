## Hi I am Scott and I love making things...
All sorts of things really, and the best place to find the things I make is at [scott.cab](https://scott.cab).

💪 I like working in the following languages / frameworks:
- [Unity](https://unity.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)

👯 Coding is always fun with other people though so I am looking to collaborate, especially on small game projects, so if you have a cool idea please reach out and say hi!
